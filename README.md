## 💻 How It Works  

Each temperature field is synced with JavaScript logic. When you input a value in any one field, the other two update automatically using the correct conversion formulas:  

- **Celsius to Fahrenheit:** `(°C × 9/5) + 32`  
- **Celsius to Kelvin:** `°C + 273.15`  
- **Fahrenheit to Celsius:** `(°F − 32) × 5/9`  
- **Fahrenheit to Kelvin:** `((°F − 32) × 5/9) + 273.15`  
- **Kelvin to Celsius:** `K − 273.15`  
- **Kelvin to Fahrenheit:** `(K − 273.15) × 9/5 + 32`
